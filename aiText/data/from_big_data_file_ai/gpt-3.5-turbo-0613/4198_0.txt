Teaching - English translation - royrib.dyrinstinkt.com Danish-English dictionary

In recent years, Danish universities are increasingly conducting a larger part of their teaching in English. The goal is to attract more international students and to prepare Danish students for an ever more internationalized job market. However, this language shift has consequences for the educational process, as shown in a new report. The students ask fewer questions and participate to a lesser extent in discussions during classes.

The switch to English as the medium of instruction has both positive and negative impacts on education. On the one hand, it increases access to a larger pool of international knowledge and facilitates communication with foreign students and faculty. It also enhances the language skills of Danish students, making them more competitive in the international job market.

On the other hand, there are concerns about the depth and quality of student engagement in the classroom. Due to language barriers or lack of language proficiency, some students may feel less confident in asking questions or participating in discussions. This can result in a more passive learning environment, where students are less actively involved in the learning process.

The report suggests that educational institutions should address these challenges by providing additional language support and training for both students and teachers. This could include language courses, workshops, and resources to improve linguistic proficiency, as well as creating an inclusive and encouraging classroom atmosphere that promotes debate and participation.

Overall, the aim of the increased use of English in education is to create a more globally competitive educational environment. However, it is important to find a balance between internationalization and ensuring the active involvement and engagement of students in their own learning process.
